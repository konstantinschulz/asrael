But not all cases are so clear-cut. Another problem arising from polysemy and homonymy is lexical ambiguity, and the precise relationship between polysemy, homonymy, ambiguity and vagueness is still an unresolved issue in lexical semantics."},

[...] in addition, [linguists] have to decide what the differences are between the near-synonyms as well as what the relation is between semantically similar words in a domain."},

So, distributionally, it is not a ‘general word’."},

For instance, the word medium, to be found in the pair magazine – medium, can be synonymous with middle, clairvoyant or again mode of communication. In the sense of clairvoyant, it is clearly more specific than in the sense intended in the test pair. As distributions do not distinguish between senses, this will have an effect on our results."},
