  abstract = {Word sense induction (WSI) is the task of unsupervised clustering of word usages within a sentence to distinguish senses. Recent work obtain strong results by clustering lexical substitutes derived from pre-trained RNN language models (ELMo). Adapting the method to BERT improves the scores even further. We extend the previous method to support a dynamic rather than a fixed number of clusters as supported by other prominent methods, and propose a method for interpreting the resulting clusters by associating them with their most informative substitutes. We then perform extensive error analysis revealing the remaining sources of errors in the WSI task. Our code is available at https://github.com/asafamr/bertwsi.},

In their work, the authors showed that the method can learn an embedding of movie review texts which can be leveraged for sentiment analysis. That proof of concept, while encouraging, was rather narrow. Here we consider tasks other than sentiment analysis, provide a more thorough comparison of Paragraph Vectors to other document modelling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and evaluate performance of the method as we vary the dimensionality of the learned representation. We benchmarked the models on two document similarity data sets, one from Wikipedia, one from arXiv. We observe that the Paragraph Vector method performs significantly better than other methods, and propose a simple improvement to enhance embedding quality. Somewhat surprisingly, we also show that much like word embeddings, vector operations on Paragraph Vectors can perform useful semantic results.},

The EuroWordNet experience revealed the shortcomings of an interlingua based on a natural language. Instead, we propose a model based on the division of the lexicon and a language-independent, formal ontology that serves as the hub interlinking the language-specific lexicons. The ontology avoids the idiosyncracies of the lexicon and furthermore allows formal reasoning about the concepts it contains. We address the division of labor between ontology and lexicon. Finally, we illustrate our model in the context of a domain-specific multilingual information system based on a central ontology and interconnected wordnets in seven languages.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) creates impactful advances following a virtuous recipe: model architecture search, creating large training data sets, and scaling computation. It is widely believed that growing training sets and models should improve accuracy and result in better products. As DL application domains grow, we would like a deeper understanding of the relationships between training set size, computational scale, and model accuracy improvements to advance the state-of-the-art. This paper presents a large scale empirical characterization of generalization error and model size growth as training sets grow. We introduce a methodology for this measurement and test four machine learning domains: machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech recognition. Our empirical results show power-law generalization error scaling across a breadth of factors, resulting in power-law exponents---the "steepness" of the learning curve---yet to be explained by theoretical work. Further, model improvements only shift the error but do not appear to affect the power-law exponent. We also show that model size scales sublinearly with data size. These scaling relationships have significant implications on deep learning research, practice, and systems. They can assist model debugging, setting accuracy targets, and decisions about data set growth. They can also guide computing system design and underscore the importance of continued computational scaling.},

In this work, we extend this approach to multiple languages and show the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining. We propose two methods to learn cross-lingual language models (XLMs): one unsupervised that only relies on monolingual data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual classification, unsupervised and supervised machine translation. On XNLI, our approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9\% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, we obtain 34.3 BLEU on WMT'16 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9 BLEU. On supervised machine translation, we obtain a new state of the art of 38.5 BLEU on WMT'16 Romanian-English, outperforming the previous best approach by more than 4 BLEU. Our code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Language is used to describe concepts, and many of these concepts are hierarchical. Moreover, this hierarchy should be compatible with forming phrases and sentences. We use linear-algebraic methods that allow us to encode words as collections of vectors. The representations we use have an ordering, related to subspace inclusion, which we interpret as modelling hierarchical information. The word representations built can be understood within a compositional distributional semantic framework, providing methods for composing words to form phrase and sentence level representations. We show that the resulting representations give competitive results on both word-level hyponymy and sentence-level entailment datasets.}

The result of dot product is unbounded, thus increases the risk of large variance. Large variance of neuron makes the model sensitive to the change of input distribution, thus results in poor generalization, and aggravates the internal covariate shift which slows down the training. To bound dot product and decrease the variance, we propose to use cosine similarity or centered cosine similarity (Pearson Correlation Coefficient) instead of dot product in neural networks, which we call cosine normalization. We compare cosine normalization with batch, weight and layer normalization in fully-connected neural networks as well as convolutional networks on the data sets of MNIST, 20NEWS GROUP, CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN. Experiments show that cosine normalization achieves better performance than other normalization techniques.},

  abstract = {Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) aims to identify the correct meaning of polysemous words in the particular context. Lexical resources like WordNet which are proved to be of great help for WSD in the knowledge-based methods. However, previous neural networks for WSD always rely on massive labeled data (context), ignoring lexical resources like glosses (sense definitions). In this paper, we integrate the context and glosses of the target word into a unified framework in order to make full use of both labeled data and lexical knowledge. Therefore, we propose GAS: a gloss-augmented WSD neural network which jointly encodes the context and glosses of the target word. GAS models the semantic relationship between the context and the gloss in an improved memory network framework, which breaks the barriers of the previous supervised methods and knowledge-based methods. We further extend the original gloss of word sense via its semantic relations in WordNet to enrich the gloss information. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-theart systems on several English all-words WSD datasets.},

  abstract = {Ontology of a domain mainly consists of concepts, taxonomical (hierarchical) relations and non-taxonomical relations. Automatic ontology construction requires methods for extracting both taxonomical and non-taxonomical relations. Compared to extensive works on concept extraction and taxonomical relation learning, little attention has been given on identification and labeling of non-taxonomical relations in text mining. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised technique for extracting non-taxonomical relations from domain texts. We propose the VF*ICF metric for measuring the importance of a verb as a representative relation label, in much the same spirit as the TF*IDF measure in information retrieval. Domain-relevant concepts (nouns) are extracted using techniques developed earlier. Candidate non-taxonomical relations are generated as (SVO) triples of the form (subject, verb, object) from domain texts. A statistical method with log-likelihood ratios is used to estimate the significance of relationships between concepts and to select suitable relation labels. Texts from two domains, the Electronic Voting (EV) domain texts and the Tenders and Mergers (TNM) domain texts are used to compare our method with one of the existing approaches. Experiments showed that our method achieved better performance in both domains.},

  abstract = {Training and testing of conventional machine learning models on binary classification problems depend on the proportions of the two outcomes in the relevant data sets. This may be especially important in practical terms when real-world applications of the classifier are either highly imbalanced or occur in unknown proportions. Intuitively, it may seem sensible to train machine learning models on data similar to the target data in terms of proportions of the two binary outcomes. However, we show that this is not the case using the example of prediction of deleterious and neutral phenotypes of human missense mutations in human genome data, for which the proportion of the binary outcome is unknown. Our results indicate that using balanced training data (50\% neutral and 50\% deleterious) results in the highest balanced accuracy (the average of True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate), Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under ROC curves, no matter what the proportions of the two phenotypes are in the testing data. Besides balancing the data by undersampling the majority class, other techniques in machine learning include oversampling the minority class, interpolating minority-class data points and various penalties for misclassifying the minority class. However, these techniques are not commonly used in either the missense phenotype prediction problem or in the prediction of disordered residues in proteins, where the imbalance problem is substantial. The appropriate approach depends on the amount of available data and the specific problem at hand.},

This study probed the developmental origins of this ability. The structure-mapping account proposes that children begin with a bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant roles in events. This account predicts that subcategorization frames should guide very early verb learning, if the number of nouns in the sentences is informative. In 3 experiments, one hundred and thirty-six 21- and 19-month-olds assigned appropriately different interpretations to novel verbs in transitive (``He's gorping him!'') versus intransitive sentences (``He's gorping!'') differing in their number of nouns. Thus, subcategorization frames guide verb interpretation in very young children. These findings constrain theoretical proposals about mechanisms for syntactic bootstrapping.},

  abstract = {Determining the intended sense of words in text - word sense disambiguation (WSD) - is a long standing problem in natural language processing. Recently, researchers have shown promising results using word vectors extracted from a neural network language model as features in WSD algorithms. However, a simple average or concatenation of word vectors for each word in a text loses the sequential and syntactic information of the text. In this paper, we study WSD with a sequence learning neural net, LSTM, to better capture the sequential and syntactic patterns of the text. To alleviate the lack of training data in all-words WSD, we employ the same LSTM in a semi-supervised label propagation classifier. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, especially on verbs.},
