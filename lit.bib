  annote = {4: Polysemie vs. Homonymie vs. Ambiguit{\"a}t vs. Vagheit: "To give a relatively clear-cut example, the homonyms (river) bank and (financial) bank would\\
be accommodated in two entries, the meanings of the polysemous word nose ('facial organ', 'sense of smell' and 'attribute of a wine') would be accommodated\\
in one. But not all cases are so clear-cut. Another problem arising from polysemy and homonymy is lexical ambiguity, and the precise relationship between polysemy, homonymy, ambiguity and vagueness is still an unresolved issue in lexical semantics."

5: polysemes Wort als Kategorie mit netzwerkartig verbundenen Mitgliedern: "In cognitive linguistics, the word itself with its network of polysemous senses came to be regarded as a category in which the senses of the word (i.e. the members of the category) are related to each other by means of general cognitive principles such as metaphor, metonymy, generalization, specialization, and image-schema transformations."}

[...] in addition, [linguists] have to decide what the differences are between the near-synonyms as well as what the relation is between semantically similar words in a domain."}

So, distributionally, it is not a `general word'."

444: bei semantischen Analysen sollte immer auf verschiedene Wortbedeutungen geachtet werden: "Some of the errors we observe may also be related to word senses. For instance, the word medium, to be found in the pair magazine \textendash{} medium, can be synonymous with middle, clairvoyant or again mode of communication. In the sense of clairvoyant, it is clearly more specific than in the sense intended in the test pair. As distributions do not distinguish between senses, this will have an effect on our results."
